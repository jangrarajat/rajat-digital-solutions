Rajat bhai, aapke code ko analyze karne ke baad, maine aapke liye ek professional GitHub Repository Description aur ek detailed README.md file taiyar ki hai.

Kyunki ye project local businesses aur aapki skills dono ko dikha raha hai, README aisa hona chahiye jo clients aur recruiters dono ko impress kare.

1. Repository Description (Short)
Is line ko GitHub repo ke "About" section (right side sidebar) mein paste karein.

"A premium digital agency website built with React.js & Tailwind CSS. Designed to help local businesses (shops, clinics, gyms) grow online with mobile-first design, SEO services, and lead generation tools."

2. README.md File
Niche diya gaya code copy karein aur apne project ke root folder mein README.md naam ki file banakar paste kar dein.

## 📖 About The Project

This project is a **Full-Featured Digital Agency Website** built by **Rajat Jangra**. It serves two purposes:
1.  **Business Portal:** To attract local clients (Shop owners, Gyms, Clinics) by offering website development, Google Maps listing, and SEO services.
2.  **Portfolio:** Showcases my technical skills, live projects, and education to potential recruiters.

The website is designed with a "Dark Premium Theme" to look professional and features a completely responsive layout that works perfectly on all mobile devices.

* **💰 Pricing Tables:** Clear, transparent pricing plans (Starter, Professional, Premium) with "Most Popular" highlighting.
* **⭐ Interactive Reviews:** A dynamic review system where users can submit ratings and testimonials (managed via React State).
* **📞 Lead Generation:** Integrated Click-to-Call and WhatsApp buttons for instant client connection.
* **🛠️ Tech Showcase:** A section detailing my skills (React, Node.js, MongoDB) and education.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend Library:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Grid, Flexbox, Gradients)
